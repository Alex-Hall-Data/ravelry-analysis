this folder contains the raw data in various stages of processing 

the yarn_data file is the raw form as downloaded from the ravelry api. It is used as an input for the 'process data' script

The yarn_data_processed is the result of the 'process_data' script. It contains all the objects generated by this script and therefore may be used to modify the data if necessary.

The processed_dataset file is the dataset only, with all other objects removed and may be used as the raw input for data mining.

The processed dataset is also saved in csv format (although this doesn't really work properly)
